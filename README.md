# ðŸ“š Coursera Flashcards

A Chrome Extension to generate notes and flashcards from Coursera video pages using OpenAI.

**Handcrafted by a fellow learner, this Chrome extension is my personal contribution to making our learning journey on Coursera a little easier.**

## ðŸ¤– What It Does

- Automatically generates flashcards from Coursera video lectures.
- Provides neat summaries of key points in a snap.
- Allows you to export these flashcards directly into Anki, making revision sessions a breeze.

    - Enter the API key in the settings menu of the extension. Note that the API key is stored in your browser's local storage and nowhere else.
